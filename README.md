# Formula 1 Race Strategy Analysis

This project analyzes Formula 1 race strategies using machine learning to predict the effects of different race parameters (such as starting position, number of laps, and pit stops) on a driver's race outcome. It provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to simulate and optimize race strategies for better results.


## Requirements

Make sure to install the required Python packages before running the project:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit matplotlib

```
## How to run the project
### Step 1: Fetch Race Data
Run ```bash fetch_data.py``` to download raw race data
```bash
python C:/Users/singh/src/fetch_data.py
```

### Step 2: Preprocess the Data
Run ```bash preprocess.py``` to clean the raw data:
