# Formula-1-Race-Strategy-Analysis
This project analyzes Formula 1 race strategies using machine learning to predict the effects of different race parameters (such as starting position, number of laps, and pit stops) on a driver's race outcome. It provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to simulate and optimize race strategies for better results.

Requirements
Make sure to install the required Python packages before running the project:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit matplotlib
How to Run the Project
Step 1: Fetch Race Data
Run fetch_data.py to download raw race data:

bash
Copy code
python C:/Users/singh/src/fetch_data.py
Step 2: Preprocess the Data
Run preprocess.py to clean the raw data:

bash
Copy code
python C:/Users/singh/src/preprocess.py
Step 3: Train the Model
Train the machine learning model using model.py:

bash
Copy code
python C:/Users/singh/src/model.py
Step 4: Run the Streamlit App
Start the Streamlit app for user interaction:

bash
Copy code
streamlit run C:/Users/singh/app.py
Example Commands
Here are the commands as used during the setup:

bash

Features
Predict Race Outcomes: Use a trained model to predict a driver's final position based on starting grid position, laps, and pit stops.
Compare Strategies: See how different pit stop strategies affect race outcomes.
Interactive UI: Adjust race parameters through a Streamlit interface and see the results in real-time.
Improvement Suggestions: Get actionable feedback on what changes could improve a driver's chances of winning the race.
