# Formula 1 Race Strategy Analysis

This project analyzes Formula 1 race strategies using machine learning to predict the effects of different race parameters (such as starting position, number of laps, and pit stops) on a driver's race outcome. It provides a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to simulate and optimize race strategies for better results.
